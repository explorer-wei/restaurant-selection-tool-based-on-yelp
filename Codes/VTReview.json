For such a quaint college town it is surprisingly void of quaint restaurants. Gillies may be the one exception. The food was yummy and inexpensive. My only complaint: The staff acted as if they had been feasting on quaaludes--glazed eyes and murmured responses. Literally next door to a vibrant college campus you would expect a pool of energetic employs to choose from, however this place remains a blackhole of enthusiasm. 4 starts for the food, however.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gomSgjEesyhMgdN8w2tBOA"},

Dinner on a Friday night came out to 13 a person.  Not bad.  They had almost everything I was looking for.  Shrimp, crab legs, Mongolian bbq.  The food was good.  However, there's a conspiracy going on in SW Virginia.  For whatever reason, there's no soft serve at Chinese buffets in this whole region.  Why?  How am I supposed to enjoy fried chinese donuts with no ice cream?  Is Coldstone running some kind of racket in these parts?  Am I the only one that cares?  Probably.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3ulgAMrHx6FFvDUMrLInDw"},

It wasn't until recently that I started to revisit them, I had forgotten how good the food is. Nothing on the menu really stands out, but it's more interesting then your average burger joint. They've got a pretty good breakfast too, it's worth getting up early for on the weekends anyway. The wait staff is typical of Blacksburg. On my last visit, I ordered one thing and received another. I didn't raise a fuss, the food was good anyway, and I got to try something I normally wouldn't have ordered.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5zyibT__dkE21sAyLb1qvA"},

St. Maeves has the perfect combination of roasted, chocolate, and bitter flavors.  By which I mean it is neither sweet nor bitter - just perfect.  The only reason I limited it to 4 stars was the food wasnt all that great.  I had the pulled pork which was okay.  Others had steaks, burgers, and ribs - all good but not great.  Their smoked baked beans are great though!  The root beer was flat and too sweet.  Great service by the bar area staff even though the place was jam packed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KsrMCDF689P4bTBrrbTLjA"},
